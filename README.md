- `getblasthits.py` - extacts hits from a BLAST output file, but only if
   they span at least a specified range of residues
- `getlastresidues.py` - extracts the last N residues from a FASTA
   alignment file replacing them with alanines if they are all deleted
- `makealignment.pl` - takes a BLAST output file and extracts the hits
